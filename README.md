By applying real-world techniques in a controlled and legal environment, EclipseRecon provides an opportunity to reinforce theoretical knowledge with practical skills. Whether you're a student preparing for a role in cybersecurity or simply exploring ethical hacking practices, this tool aims to support your learning journey and deepen your understanding of how to assess and protect web environments. 🔐🎓

🙏 I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Santiago Hernández, a leading expert in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/user/shramos/). His outstanding course on **Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking**, available on Udemy, was instrumental in the development of this project. The insights and techniques I gained from his course were invaluable in guiding my approach to cybersecurity practices. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and expertise!

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This tool is intended for ethical hacking and educational purposes only. Always ensure you have authorization before testing any systems.

> ⚠️ All tests and security analysis workflows in **EclipseRecon** were conducted in a controlled environment using deliberately vulnerable websites based on the VPLE (Vulnerable Web Platform for Learning and Exploitation) virtual machine, which is designed specifically for security testing and training purposes. This testing was carried out in a dedicated **lab environment** to ensure ethical use and avoid unauthorized access to any external systems. The results of these tests demonstrate the tool’s effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in a controlled, safe, and legal environment.

## 🌍 Practical Use Cases

EclipseRecon was developed as part of a learning process to explore real-world web reconnaissance techniques. While it’s not intended for production use, it offers practical value in educational and training contexts such as:

1. 🛡️ **Penetration Testing Practice**: Simulate asset enumeration and identify common weaknesses in lab environments to understand the core phases of a penetration test.  
2. 🪲 **Bug Bounty Simulations**: Practice participating in bug bounty programs by learning how to identify hidden entry points, subdomains, and potential vulnerabilities in controlled scenarios.  
3. 📊 **Security Auditing Training**: Gain experience in mapping an organization's digital footprint and documenting findings through structured reports.  
4. ✅ **Compliance Familiarization**: Apply OWASP-based checks to understand how security standards work in practice and what it means to align assessments with industry-recognized frameworks.  

This project is ideal for students, ethical hacking enthusiasts, and anyone learning how to responsibly conduct reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery in a safe, hands-on way. 🚀

## 📋 Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what EclipseRecon does:

1. **🧭 Initialization**:
   - Validates the target (IP address or domain).
   - Configures proxies and scanning depth.
2. **🔎 Subdomain Scanning**:
   - Discovers subdomains using the `SubdomainScanner` module.
   - Outputs a list of discovered subdomains.
3. **🔧 Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Scans discovered subdomains or the target for vulnerabilities.
   - Leverages the `WebVulnerabilityScanner` to find potential risks.
4. **🕷️ Website Crawling**:
   - Generates sitemaps by crawling websites or subdomains.
   - Uses the `WebsiteSpider` to map the site structure.
5. **🛡️ OWASP Analysis**:
   - Performs OWASP security checks on targets.
   - Uses the `OwaspSecurityScanner` for detailed testing.
6. **📄 Report Generation**:
   - Compiles results into PDF and JSON reports.
   - Uses the `SecurityAnalyzer` to generate professional-grade reports.
