## 🎯 Purpose
The primary objective of EclipseRecon is to assist ethical hackers and security analysts in:

- Discovering hidden subdomains.
- Scanning for common vulnerabilities.
- Crawling websites for security insights.
- Performing OWASP-compliant security analysis.
- Generating comprehensive security reports.

By consolidating multiple scanning methodologies, EclipseRecon saves time and enhances accuracy during penetration testing and security assessments.

## 🛠 Features
- **Subdomain Scanning**: Discover subdomains to map the attack surface.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Detect common vulnerabilities across web assets.
- **Website Crawling**: Generate sitemaps and analyze website structure.
- **OWASP Testing**: Perform advanced security checks aligned with OWASP standards.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Export results as PDF and JSON reports for further analysis.

## 🌍 Practical Use Cases
EclipseRecon is ideal for:

1. **Penetration Testing**: Quickly enumerate assets and identify weaknesses in a target's infrastructure.
2. **Bug Bounty Hunting**: Identify hidden entry points and vulnerabilities in target systems.
3. **Security Auditing**: Analyze and report on an organization's digital footprint.
4. **Compliance Checks**: Perform OWASP-based analysis to ensure security compliance.

## 📋 Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what EclipseRecon does:

1. **🧭 Initialization**:
   - Validates the target (IP address or domain).
   - Configures proxies and scanning depth.
2. **🔎 Subdomain Scanning**:
   - Discovers subdomains using the `SubdomainScanner` module.
   - Outputs a list of discovered subdomains.
3. **🔧 Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Scans discovered subdomains or the target for vulnerabilities.
   - Leverages the `WebVulnerabilityScanner` to find potential risks.
4. **🕷️ Website Crawling**:
   - Generates sitemaps by crawling websites or subdomains.
   - Uses the `WebsiteSpider` to map the site structure.
5. **🛡️ OWASP Analysis**:
   - Performs OWASP security checks on targets.
   - Uses the `OwaspSecurityScanner` for detailed testing.
6. **📄 Report Generation**:
   - Compiles results into PDF and JSON reports.
   - Uses the `SecurityAnalyzer` to generate professional-grade reports.
